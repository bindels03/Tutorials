### **Work Instructions: Flashing Jetson ReComputer J4012 Using a Live USB and USB as Storage**  

These instructions guide you through setting up a **Live Ubuntu USB**, configuring an external **USB drive as the primary storage**, and preparing the system for flashing a **Jetson device**.

---

## **Step 1: Prepare the Live USB**
1. **Download Ubuntu ISO**  
   - Obtain the latest **Ubuntu Desktop ISO** (recommended version: **Ubuntu 20.04+**).
  
2. **Create the Live USB**  
   - Use **Rufus** (Windows) or `dd` (Linux/macOS) to write the ISO to a **USB flash drive** (minimum **8GB** recommended).  
   - If using Rufus:  
     - Select **MBR** partition scheme.  
     - Use **FAT32** for compatibility.  
     - Enable **Persistent Storage** if you want to keep changes after reboot.  

3. **Boot from the Live USB**  
   - Insert the Live USB into the **host PC**.  
   - Enter BIOS/boot menu and boot from the USB.  
   - Select **"Try Ubuntu"** (do not install).

## **Step 2: Set Up External USB as the Storage Device**
1. **Insert the USB drive** (this will act as the working storage).  
2. **Find the USB device name**:  
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   - Look for a drive like `/dev/sdb` (size should match your USB drive).  

3. **Format the USB drive**:  
   - If you need a fresh setup, format it as **ext4**:  
     ```bash
     sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX
     ```
     *(Replace `sdX` with the correct drive name, e.g., `sdb`.)*  

4. **Mount the USB drive for use**:  
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/jetson
   sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/jetson
   ```
   *(Replace `sdX` with your actual device name.)*  

5. **Give full permissions**:  
   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/jetson
   ```

## **Step 3: Copy Jetson Flashing Files to USB Storage**
1. **Check the official tutorial for the latest download links:**

2. **Download the necessary Jetson files to the Live USB session.**  
3. **Move the extracted files to the mounted USB drive** (this USB will serve as the working directory for completing the flashing process):  
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r /path/to/Jetson_Files /mnt/jetson/
   ```
4. **Verify ownership and permissions**:  
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /mnt/jetson
   sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/jetson
   ```

---

## **Step 4: Grant Root Access for Flashing**
1. **Open a root shell**:  
   ```bash
   sudo -i
   ```
   *(This ensures all commands have the necessary privileges.)*  
2. **Navigate to the working directory**:  
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/jetson/Linux_for_Tegra/
   ```

## **Step 5: Continue with Flashing Instructions**
To proceed with flashing the Jetson device, follow the official instructions here:  
ðŸ”— [Seeed Studio: Flash JetPack on reComputer J4012](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reComputer_J4012_Flash_Jetpack/)

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** All commands in the official tutorial should be run from the **mounted USB directory** (`/mnt/jetson`), where the JetPack files were moved earlier.

---

### **Notes:**
- Using **persistent storage** on a Live USB can help, but a **full install on a USB drive** is more reliable.  
- **USB 3.0+ is strongly recommended** for better write speeds.  
- **If using a slow USB**, expect `apply_binaries.sh` and `syncing system.img` to take **significantly longer** than on an SSD.  
- When troubleshooting, always check `iotop` and `top` to monitor **disk activity and CPU usage**.

---

### **Future Use:**
- These steps remain the same for **future JetPack versions**, with the only variation being the **flashing script**.  
- Keeping an **Ubuntu full installation on a USB drive** makes the setup more stable for future flashing.

---

### **Summary:**
âœ” **Set up Live USB**  
âœ” **Mount and prepare USB as storage**  
âœ” **Copy and apply permissions to Jetson files**  
âœ” **Grant root access for flashing**  
âœ” **Follow the official Seeed Studio guide to flash the device**
